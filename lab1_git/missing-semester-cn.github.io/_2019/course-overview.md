# Motivation

This class is about [hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture)
tools, not [hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker) tools.

MIT classes do not cover any of this content in detail. It's hugely beneficial
to be proficient with your tools: it'll save you a lot of time (and the payoff
time is very short).

We want to teach you about new tools, how to make the most of your tools, how
to customize your tools, and how to extend your tools.

# Class structure

We have 6 lectures covering a [variety of topics](/schedule/). We have lecture
notes online, but there will be a lot of content covered in class (e.g. in the
form of demos) that may not be in the notes. We will be recording lectures.

Each class is split into two 50-minute lectures with a 10-minute break in
between. Lectures are mostly live demonstrations followed by hands-on
exercises. We might have a short amount of time at the end of each class to get
started on the exercises in an office-hours-style setting.

To make the most of the class, you should go through all the exercises on your
own. We'll inspire you to learn more about your tools, and we'll show you
what's possible and cover some of the basics in detail, but we can't teach you
everything in the time we have.

Please post questions on [r/hackertools]. In addition, we ask that you share your
knowledge with your classmates through [r/hackertools] --- **for "homework" for each
lecture, create a post or comment about something you've learned or something you'd
like to share about the topic**.
